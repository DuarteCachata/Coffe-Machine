# Coffe-Machine

```Status:```
in development.

```Project Objectives:``` 
The project involves the development of a circuit to control a coffee making machine, using a flowchart and a fixed machine. The proposed problem was to use a flowchart to create a circuit that controls a coffee machine, simulating the complete process of preparing the drink.

```Inputs:``` 
The inputs used were F1, S1, TOK, X1, TIMER_SLOW and TIMER_FAST. F1 is the button responsible for starting the coffee preparation process, while X1 indicates whether a capsule has been inserted into the machine. The TOK checks whether the correct temperature has been reached, and the S1 monitors the operation of the water pump.

```Outputs:``` 
 The outputs used were B1, R1, LED, BZ, V1 and ST. The water pump (B1) and the heating element (R1) are crucial components for the coffee machine to function. The LED indicates the status of the machine, the BZ emits a beep when the coffee is ready, and the V1 allows the coffee to flow. For example, if a coffee capsule is not inserted, the machine must inform the user via the LED.
